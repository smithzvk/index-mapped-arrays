* Index Mapped Arrays

arrays.  It quickly generalized to a generic, versatile interface to any data
that could represent an array of data.

** Known issues

In CMUCL, you cannot (modf (get-block ...) ...).  This is because Alexandria's
copy-array function doesn't work right on CMUCL.  For evidence, try (copy-array
(copy-array #2A((1 2) (3 4)))).
